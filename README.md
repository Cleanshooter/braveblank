==========
These are the files used to run the vote floating table seen on BraveBlank. I will frequently update it as I add new
additions to the code. It is mainly coded in PHP and referneces a JS library and HTML framework from one of my tablepress
plugins to dynamically generate the table.

$dbc represents the connection variable with the connection constants
